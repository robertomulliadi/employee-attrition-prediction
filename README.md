# üìä Employee Attrition Prediction

This project explores machine learning techniques to predict employee attrition using structured HR data. It focuses on building interpretable models that balance performance with practical business insight.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used
- Python, Jupyter, scikit-learn, XGBoost, SHAP
- R (for exploratory data analysis)

---

## üîç Project Steps
1. **EDA (in R):** Visualized key relationships (e.g., job satisfaction, overtime)
2. **Baseline Modeling:** Trained logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and XGBoost
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Improved random forest and XGBoost using GridSearchCV
4. **Model Evaluation:** Focused on recall, precision, F1-score, and ROC-AUC for attrition class
5. **Model Interpretation:** Used SHAP to explain predictions globally and at the individual level

## ‚úÖ Best Model Performance
- **Model:** Random Forest (tuned)
- **Recall (leavers):** 0.49
- **Precision (leavers):** 0.43
- **F1-score (leavers):** 0.46
- **ROC-AUC:** 0.77

These results indicate a good balance between identifying employees likely to leave and minimizing false positives, particularly given the class imbalance (~16% attrition rate).

## üí° SHAP Insights
- **Overtime** is the strongest predictor of attrition.
- **Low stock option level, income, and satisfaction** increase risk.
- SHAP provided **transparent, feature-level explanations** for both overall trends and individual cases.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Why Stacking Was Not Used
Stacking models were explored but ultimately excluded due to convergence and stability issues during training, with minimal expected performance gain.
